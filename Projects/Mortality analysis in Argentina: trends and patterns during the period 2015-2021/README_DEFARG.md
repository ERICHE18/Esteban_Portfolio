The tools used for data cleaning, extraction, preparation, and analysis were:

- __Excel__: Data cleaning was performed using Excel, as well as preliminary analysis using pivot tables and charts. The table created was later used in Power BI

- __R__: Like SQL, the R programming language was used to filter, sort, and validate the data to ensure its accuracy.
