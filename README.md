Welcome to my Data Analyst portfolio on GitHub!
In this repository, you will find data projects and analyses that I have completed throughout my career as a Data Analyst. My objective is to demonstrate my ability to obtain, clean, visualize, and interpret data to make informed decisions.

If you're interested in seeing how I apply my skills as a Data Analyst to real-world problems, be sure to check out my portfolio website at [https://esrichecontacto.wixsite.com/esteban-r](https://esrichecontacto.wixsite.com/esteban-r). There, you'll find even more examples of my work, as well as information about my experience and qualifications. Thank you for visiting my GitHub portfolio!
